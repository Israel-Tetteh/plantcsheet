Description: Provides a Shiny-based interface for plant tissue culture
  laboratories to design standardized experimental datasheets,
  export them as Excel workbooks, and automatically populate them with treatment,
  replication, and time-point structures.
  The package streamlines data capture by enforcing consistent variable naming, metadata fields,
  and layout templates tailored to tissue culture workflows,
  reducing manual spreadsheet setup and improving downstream analysis in R.
